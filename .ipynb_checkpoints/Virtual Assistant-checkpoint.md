# Recommendating Virtual Assistant for Sustainable Waste Management Onboard Cruise Ship

## Background

In this work, a dataproduct will be produced by using data science tools and machine learning (ML) algorithms that would help a cruise ship operator to plan the future waste management operations by a most sustainable and feasible way. The project work is done by constructing the ML-product by using real shipboard operational data and external web sources. The purpose is to create ML-system that would give a decent picture and prediction of the best option for the operations.

The main goal is to produce a tool and by no means aiming for a product that would give a comprehensive picture of the whole situation.
