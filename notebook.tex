\hypertarget{background}{%
\subsection{Background}\label{background}}

In this work, a dataproduct will be produced by using data science tools
and machine learning (ML) algorithms that would help a cruise ship
operator to plan the future waste management operations by a most
sustainable and feasible way. The project work is done by constructing
the ML-product by using real shipboard operational data and external web
sources. The purpose is to create ML-system that would give a decent
picture and prediction of the best option for the operations.

The main goal is to produce a tool and by no means aiming for a product
that would give a comprehensive picture of the whole situation. The work
is done with Jupyter Lab and by using Anaconda Python package management
system, meaning thatthe coding part will be done on Python language.

There are two aspects in this work: Sustainability and feasibility. Evac
Oy supplies integrated cleantech solutions, including e.g.~waste
management systems, to all types of ships. The sustainability is the key
value for all major cruise ship owners. Not only because of regulations
and guidelines, but because of acceptability of the cruise business as a
whole. The sustainability part will be done as a prediction by using
mass balance of recyclable materials and carbon balance derived from the
balance. In addition to sustainability, the operations should preferably
be as economical as possible. This part would be covered by market price
data of recyclable materials as well as the carbon price.

\hypertarget{goals-and-risks}{%
\subsubsection{Goals and risks}\label{goals-and-risks}}

The goal is to study how to extract usable data from the existing
sources, clean and explore the data so that a usable predictive ML
models could be produced and trained with new and fresh data in the
future from the IoT-system. If this goal is achieved, it may be worth of
considering to apply and further develop the extent of the work to an
usable data science product.

The IoT-system that would be used for the purpose is installed and
connected to our recent new-build cruise ship project. The risk is that
the availability of the data may delay. In that case, we need to somehow
``construct'' the data based on our best knowledge. I am planning to
parse a part of the data from the web. The other risk is that the data
cannot be parsed and cleaned properly due to complexity into a usable
form. Third risk here may be that the available relevant data may not be
sufficient for training of the constructed ML model.

\hypertarget{data-perspective}{%
\subsubsection{Data Perspective}\label{data-perspective}}

There are both internal and external data sources here that would be
used. The internal data source would be a dry and wet waste production
data. That would be derived on a daily basis from the ship IoT-system in
form of CSV-files. One CSV file for the dry waste production and one for
the wet waste production. The external data would be historical trends
of market values of recycled materials and value of carbon in terms of
greenhouse gas emission abatement.

Concerning the data availability, I have already contacted the ship
owner for the waste data. As mentioned, the raw data would be in form of
CSV-files. Some data wrangling with Pandas is needed as well as
calculations for the deriving the actual values. The challenge for the
shipboard data is the timing of the availability. We are working on that
matter. In terms of market value information, some data is already
gained. However, I would like to automize this activity as a continuous
retrieval of the information. That wouldupdate the output signal of the
ML-model each time the data would be available. The challenge here may
be to find a data source that would produce a single value. For this
project work purpose, we may need to use the source that is fairl easily
available.
